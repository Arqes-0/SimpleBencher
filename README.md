# SimpleBencher

**SimpleBencher** is a lightweight benchmarking tool written in C that calculates prime numbers and measures the performance of the process. It displays the time taken for execution and calculates a performance score based on the speed.

## Features

- Finds and counts prime numbers up to a specified limit.
- Measures the execution time and displays a performance score.
- Shows the time taken in seconds.
